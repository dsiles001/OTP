# OTP

Input the message that you want to encrypt. It will then show the encrypted version of 
your message (may just be multiple blank spaces). It will then decrypt it right back to 
your original message.

(Multiple lists of binaries will appear during this process. The order is the message in binary, the key in binary, and the encrypted message in binary)
